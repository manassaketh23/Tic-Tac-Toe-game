# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
The Tic-Tac-Toe code in Python allows two players to take turns placing "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for a winner after each move and handles invalid input. The board is displayed after each turn, and the game ends when a player wins or the board is full, resulting in a draw.
